Define a reusable function called `ASR` that computes the absorbed shortwave radiation, and a function called `OLR` that computes the outgoing longwave radiation, for any values of albedo, transmissivity, solar flux, and temperature.  Define and use appropriate default values for the arguments.\n",
    "    - Compute the instantaneous ASR and OLR with these new values of albedo and transmissivity, and today's observed temperature.\n",
