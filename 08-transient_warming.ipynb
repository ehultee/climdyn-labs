    "In previous weeks, we have computed the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity, which tells us how much warming will eventually result from a doubling of CO$_2$ (once the Earth system reaches equilibrium).  But we know that CO2 doesn't instantly double, and the climate takes some time to reach its equilibrium temperature.  In this notebook, we will simulate changes over time with Climlab, and then we will use another simulator called En-ROADS to explore global actions to mitigate CO$_2$.\n",
