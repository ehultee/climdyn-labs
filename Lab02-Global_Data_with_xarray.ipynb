    "1. Read and inspect the data.  Answer questions 1-3 on the paper lab sheet.\n",
    "2. Conduct a closer inspection with summary statistics.  Compute the mean of at least one component -- for simplicity choose outgoing longwave radiation. Determine whether it has the correct order of magnitude by comparing with the Trenberth, Fasullo, and Kiehl figure.\n",
    "3. Make global plots of each component (solar_clim, shortwave, longwave)\n",
    "4. Compute the **energy balance**: incoming (solar_clim) minus outgoing (shortwave and longwave).\n",
    "5. Address the science questions by:\n",
    "    - Computing the *area weighted average* of the energy balance\n",
    "    - Producing a global plot of net energy balance\n",
    "    - Producing two seasonally offset plots of net energy balance, selecting a specific month (e.g. months 1 and 7)"
