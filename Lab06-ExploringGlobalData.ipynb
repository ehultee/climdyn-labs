    "Choose one of the science questions above.  Choose the appropriate dataset to address your question from the pre-processed \"Monthly surface (3D)\" ERA5 datasets linked on [this page](https://fabienmaussion.info/climate_system/download.html) and download it.  With your partner, make a plan to explore this dataset.  You might want to draft your plan on paper before starting to code.  \n",

    "At minimum, the code and text you write below should allow you to:\n",
    "1. Search the internet for basic information about the data source.  Answer the following questions:\n",
    "    - What is ERA5? \n",
    "    - What institution provides the data? \n",
    "    - What time period is it available for?  \n",
    "2. Load in the dataset; identify what variable(s) are included and their physical meaning.\n",
    "    - What are the dimensions of the variables?\n",
    "    - What is the spatial resolution of this dataset?\n",
    "    - What is its temporal resolution?\n",
    "    - What is the data type of the various variables and coordinates available in the dataset? What are the differences between each data type?\n",
    "3. Perform a \"sanity check\" to confirm the data have loaded in correctly.\n",
    "    - Consider making a plot, computing average/max/min values, time slices, etc.\n",
    "4. Use an appropriate technique (global plot, regional plot, monthly climatology, selecting or averaging over certain dimensions) to address your science question.\n",
    "5. Write text directly responding to the science question based on your analysis.\n",
    "6. Time allowing: propose another science question that could be investigated with your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to include **text cells describing the approach and interpretation**, and **comments in the code** to aid readability."
